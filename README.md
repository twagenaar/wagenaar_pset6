This app let's you search for movies and add them to your watchlist.
You can only keep your watchlist when you're logged in, but you can still search movies when you're not logged in. 

There is a bug which I was not able to solve with the logging in. When you log in, the menu is not updated unless you rotate the screen or click the menu buttons again.
